      <h1>The world's finest lightweight bearings balls</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Large bearing balls are heavy, but they don’t need to be. 
        Many applications that require large bearing balls don’t require 
        the tremendous load-bearing capacity they offer, so most of the material 
        of a solid steel bearing ball is wasted. 
      <br>  
        You could opt for a lighter
        material, like titanium or aluminum, but these materials are either 
        too expensive or aren’t hard enough. Or you could choose a hollow ball, 
        but material options and load capacity were limited, until now.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Aircore Bearings offers the world’s first and only hollow 440C stainless steel bearing balls. 
        Our proprietary manufacturing process allows customers to dial in the load capacity
        to their requirements in a variety of materials and diameters.
